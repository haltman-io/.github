## Haltman
Haltman is "halt" + "man"

### What is
Haltman is a pseudonym created to share knowledge freely, without the risk of sanctions or conflicts of interest. **Haltman.io does not represent a company**.

To be honest, Haltman.io doesn't represent any group or team. I just wanted to save what I'd already done without mixing it with my other identities, and I was too lazy to create another GitHub account.

It is simply a public communication platform for sharing knowledge without direct exposure.

### Intellectual property / License
I don't believe in intellectual property or licensing; honestly, I don't even think any project here is important enough to apply any of those fictitious concepts.

But I understand the responsibility of those who need to ensure that I truly relinquish such imaginary rights, which is why all projects here on GitHub are licensed under "The Unlicense" - https://unlicense.org.

You are free to copy, integrate, modify, contribute, use, sell, market, etc.

### Requirement
I ask that you do not use anything here to carry out malicious or criminal activities, or to attack anything/anyone you are not authorized to attack.

I also ask that you do not use the tools to abuse public services.

### Report abuse / misusage
Here, I share The Hacker's Choice's stance on this. Read more at: https://www.thc.org/abuse/
