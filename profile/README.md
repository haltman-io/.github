### Intellectual property / License
I don't believe in intellectual property or licensing; honestly, I don't even think any project here is important enough to apply any of those fictitious concepts. But I understand the responsibility of those who need to ensure that I truly relinquish such imaginary rights, which is why all projects here on GitHub are licensed under "The Unlicense" - https://unlicense.org. You are free to copy, integrate, modify, contribute, use, sell, market, etc.

### Requirement
I ask that you do not use anything here to carry out malicious or criminal activities, or to attack anything/anyone you are not authorized to attack. I also ask that you do not use the tools to abuse public services.

### Report abuse / misusage
Here, I share The Hacker's Choice's stance on this. My contact: `abuse@haltman.io`
